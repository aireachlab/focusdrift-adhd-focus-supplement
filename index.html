      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <details><summary>Why do stimulants make me crash after working?</summary><p>Stimulants spike dopamine fast, which can backfire for ADHD brains. FocusDrift uses adaptogens to support smoother, longer-lasting focus without that hard comedown.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Is FocusDrift safe to stack with my ADHD medication?</summary><p>FocusDrift is non-stimulant and designed to complement — not replace — prescription treatment. Many users stack it to soften edges or on non-med days.</p></details>
      <details><summary>How does FocusDrift actually help with ADHD focus?</summary><p>It supports calm attentiveness using ingredients like L-theanine and Rhodiola, which help reduce distraction and mental fatigue without overstimulating the nervous system.</p></details>
      <details><summary>What does it feel like to take FocusDrift?</summary><p>Most describe it as a ‘soft lock-in’ — you notice less noise, fewer mental tabs open, and a clearer sense of where your attention wants to go.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Can I take this daily without building a tolerance?</summary><p>Yes, it’s designed for daily use without dependency. The adaptogens and nootropics used are tolerance-stable over time.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Is this just another productivity pill with a new label?</summary><p>Nope. FocusDrift is built specifically for neurodivergent minds — not hustle culture. It's for real-world presence, not artificial energy boosts.</p></details>
